Right now pre-probing was done and working but I was trying to re open the TCP connection and 
moving stuff around so it broke. gonna work on it on monday and was starting UDP connection stuff
Rn the Client was sending pre-seeded "config data," so I manually wrote it in there but it was 
sending and the server was recieving the data just fine before it broke.

ALSO: client2.c is the original one started before client.c and server.c is the one I made

TODO:
fix bug
write and import config
create UDP packet
establish UDP send/recieve to send UDP packet
figure out compression
Open TCP socket again to send compression results back
